# Recommended Notes

- Built-in presets updated:

  - `Plug` default is now **unchecked** for the included presets.
  - `Small liner` defaults added: size `5" 18#` (ID `4.276`), Top `3691`, Shoe `4992`.

- Testing checklist:

  - Load the built-in preset (e.g., `P-9`) and verify the `Plug` checkbox is unchecked and `Small liner` fields are set.
  - Toggle the `Plug` checkbox and ensure the plug panel hides/shows and the schematic plug line appears as expected.
  - Click the Small liner `Liner` button to ensure it sets `Top` = Reservoir Shoe - 50.
  - Draw schematic and confirm ordering: `Small liner` renders above `Reservoir`.

- Changelog and notes were updated on 2026-01-17 to reflect these changes.
