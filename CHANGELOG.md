## [Unreleased] - 2026-01-17
### Added
- Plug feature: add `plug` panel with depth input and a `Plug` toggle. App now computes and displays volumes above and below the plug and draws a plug line on the schematic.
- UI/UX: moved the plug toggle, added `plug-panel` and `plug-toggle`, improved styling for the Total Volume area and plug panel.
- Styling: nudged casing headings to better align with inline checkboxes and hide inline header controls (e.g., `Tie-back`, `Dummy hanger`) when sections are collapsed.
